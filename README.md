This app uses Python, the GPT-3 API, and Django to generate web articles.

## How it works

The app first uses the GPT-3 API to generate a text article. The GPT-3 API is a large language model that can generate human-quality text. Once the text article is generated, the Django API is used to create a web page for the article. The web page includes the article text, as well as a title, author, and date.

## Features

The app includes the following features:

* The ability to generate text articles from a variety of topics.
* The ability to customize the title, author, and date of the article.
* The ability to save the article to a local file.

## Usage

To use the app, open the web page and enter the desired topic in the text field. The app will then generate a text article on the topic. You can customize the title, author, and date of the article, and then save the article to a local file.
